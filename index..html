                    Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)[1] is a sweetened frozen food typically
                    eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, cashew,
                    coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative,
                    and any spice, such as cocoa or vanilla.</p>

                    Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
                    The earliest evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC.</p>

                    Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars. Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable, except when in excess.[citation needed] In addition to sugars like sucrose, 
                    many other chemical compounds are sweet, including aldehydes, ketones, and sugar alcohols.</p>
